## Presentation

Placeholder

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Dependecies

- `Make` : To run with the Makefile
- `Java` : Obviously

## How to run it
```sh
make build
make run
```
Try to run make build once, it's safer
